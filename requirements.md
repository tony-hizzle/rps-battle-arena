## Project Overview
**Project Name:** RPS Battle Arena
**Challenge:** Disney Hack the Code Challenge
**Development Tool:** Amazon Q Developer (IDE experience)

## Use Case Definition
Create an engaging multiplayer web application where users can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against other online players in real-time. The application will provide a fun, competitive gaming experience while tracking player statistics and win records.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
- [x] User registration and authentication
- [ ] Real-time multiplayer game matching
- [x] Rock, Paper, Scissors game logic
- [x] Win/loss tracking and statistics
- [x] Game history and leaderboard
- [ ] Real-time game state synchronization

### User Stories
- As a player, I want to create an account so that my wins are tracked
- As a player, I want to be matched with another online player so that I can play Rock, Paper, Scissors
- As a player, I want to see my win/loss record so that I can track my performance
- As a player, I want to see a leaderboard so that I can compare my performance with others
- As a player, I want real-time gameplay so that the experience feels responsive and engaging

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- [ ] Game moves processed within 100ms
- [ ] Support for 100+ concurrent players
- [ ] Real-time updates with <500ms latency

### Security
- [ ] Secure user authentication
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Protection against cheating/manipulation

### Availability & Reliability
- [ ] 99.5% uptime target
- [ ] Graceful handling of disconnections
- [ ] Basic monitoring and logging

## Technical Requirements

### AWS Services (Proposed)
- [ ] Amazon S3 (Static website hosting)
- [ ] Amazon API Gateway (REST API)
- [ ] AWS Lambda (Serverless backend logic)
- [ ] Amazon DynamoDB (User data and game statistics)
- [ ] Amazon Cognito (User authentication)
- [ ] AWS WebSocket API (Real-time communication)
- [ ] Amazon CloudFront (Content delivery)

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] WebSocket connections for real-time gameplay
- [ ] REST API for user management and statistics
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration

### Deployment Requirements
- [ ] Serverless architecture deployment
- [ ] AWS CDK or CloudFormation for infrastructure
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use native AWS services
- Must demonstrate Amazon Q Developer capabilities
- Serverless-first architecture
- Single-page web application

### Assumptions
- Players have modern web browsers with WebSocket support
- Basic internet connectivity for real-time gameplay
- Simple username-based authentication is sufficient

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Two players can successfully play Rock, Paper, Scissors in real-time
- [x] Win/loss statistics are accurately tracked and displayed
- [x] Application handles player connections and disconnections gracefully
- [x] Game logic correctly determines winners (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock)
- [x] Leaderboard displays top players by win count

## Out of Scope
- Advanced matchmaking algorithms
- Tournament brackets or advanced game modes
- Social features (chat, friends, etc.)
- Mobile app development
- Advanced analytics or reporting
